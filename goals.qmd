# Objectives

The assessment study presented in this thesis aims to provide further evidence into effectively addressing the global challenge of plastic production and their impact in marine ecosystems, focusing on the environmental degradability of commercial compostable plastics. Following the previously provided evidence, under the assumption that these materials are equally like of being mismanaged and littered as conventional plastics, persistency of bioplastics. The comparison of sea and lake water is intended to provide a holistic approach to the heterogeneous environmental conditions of the aquatic environment, which determine the ultimate biodegradability of the studied material.
