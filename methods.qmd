## Theoretical principle: Oxygen demand as a proxy for biodegradation

Oxygen demand is a widely used parameter in the quantification of biodegradation because it enables for the rapid assessment of microbial activity during the process. The present study approaches compostable plastic biodegradation in only 30 days by incubating the material in a reactor medium already pre-exposed to environmental conditions. Some authors consider biodegradation by physically evaluating the post-incubation polymer [@pelegrini2016]. These approaches usually require incubation for long periods of time, for the purpose of fast assessment the physical properties of the materials were not evaluated.

### Recreating the open environment

The test medium recreated the natural environment on the submerged sediment at the near beach zone inside a sealed reactor. The two-phase approach (sediment and water column) was suggested by @tosin2012 in an attempt to simulate the conditions of a plastic item that has sunk to the bottom of the sea floor, the present study substitutes the preparation of a synthetic aqueous solution with field samples instead, the reason for this adaptation is to accurately resemble the open environment while maintaining simplicity. In this study, reactors consisted of 1 L glass vessels sealed using the OxiTop^Ⓡ^ Control system. The head of the measuring device is equipped with a highly sensitive pressure gauge capable of measuring the pressure evolution inside the reactor. A cup holds a strongly alkaline solution of NaOH in contact with the aerial phase to trap the CO~2~ produced by microbial activity. Testing materials were placed on the sediment bed using a pair of tweezers and bioplastic films were rigorously cleared of bubbles adhering to the surface to prevent the specimen from rising afloat. Relative positions of elements inside the reactor can be elucidated in @fig-reactors.

### Biochemical reaction chain

Plastic biodegradation, sometimes also referred as mineralization, is a complex biochemical process involving the conversion of the organic constituents of the polymer through microbial activity to carbon dioxide (CO~2~), new microbial biomass, water and mineral salts in the presence of oxygen gas (O~2~) as schematically summarized in the equation:

$$
\ce{Plastic + O2(g) ->[Microbes] Biomass + CO2(g) + Minerals}
$$

Consequently, the biodegradation process is measurable by analyzing the amount of O~2~ consumed or inversely the amount of CO~2~ produced. The reactor is designed to trap the produced CO~2~ as an insoluble precipitate inside a strongly alkaline solution of NaOH following the reaction:

$$
\ce{CO2(aq) + 2Na^+(aq) + 2OH- + H2O -> Na2CO3(solid) + 2H2O}
$$

Therefore pressure inside the reactor falls due to the sequestration of CO~2~ and this measurable difference is translated into oxygen demand as detailed in @sec-stats.

## Experimental methods

### Testing materials

Compostable plastic bags were provided by @deiss2025 in the context of the @soplas2024, the material is commercially available under the trademark name ecovio^Ⓡ^ [@basf2025] and is made by blending PLA and PBAT polymers at variable proportions. PLA is synthesized from renewable feedstocks such as corn and sugar cane while PBAT has a nonrenewable fossil origin, resulting in a 50% renewable-based material with certified compostability under the European standard EN 13432 [@eubp2023]. Laboratory-grade filter paper was used as positive control test material as suggested by @tosin2012, paper consists of cellulose which is a commonly occurring polymer known to be biodegradable in all kinds of aerobic environments including freshwater and saltwater [@royer2023]. The purpose of testing paper is to compare the measured respirometrical response of a known biodegradable material with that of the compostable plastic subject to the assessment. A recent study by @beiras2023 demonstrated that compostable plastic bags show similar rates of biodegradation disregarding the degree of grinding. Here, the plastic films (20 µm thick) were cut into disk shapes of 20 mm diameter which stand for an easily replicable and standardized testing unit, the same procedure was adopted to a sheet of filter paper. To avoid contaminating the samples with room microbes, manipulation was done using sterilized tweezers.

### Environmental sample collection

Sediment and water samples were collected from 2 beaches of both freshwater and seawater environments in Andalusia, Spain. Sampled beaches are recognized under Blue Flag certification by the Foundation for Environmental Education [@adeac2024], the focus of the study is to assess potential biodegradation in beaches under pressure from plastic pollution threfore the Blue Flag offers a criteria for high occupation indicating a plastic littering hotspot. Firstly, La Breña Reservoir is a freshwater body located in Almodóvar del Río, Córdoba (37°49'55.20''N, 5°2'12.84''W) which offers a paramount prepositional environment. Freshwater and sediment collection was done close to the shore at a water depth of 1 m to ensure the microbial community living in the sediment is fully adapted to submerged conditions. Organic elemnts such as wood pieces were avoided during sampling in order to obtain a homogeneous detrital sediment. Secondly, Los Boliches Beach is located at the Mediterranean coast of Fuengirola, Málaga (36°32'52.44''N, 4°36'54.72''W) which is highly urbanized and dedicated to tourism. Sampling was conducted at further distance to the shore at 2 m depth during mid-tide targeting the suborbital zone. Samples were directly refrigerated after collection to minimize bacterial activity during storage.

### Preliminary tests

Preliminary tests were conducted before ultimate incubation to guarantee satisfactory results. Plastic testing units went through a sinking test to confirm films would remain laying on the sediment bed, a polymer density higher than 1 g cm^-3^ results in negative buoyancy however small air bubbles adhering to the surface of the plastic made it difficult to sink, to solve the issue thorough clearing was applied using fine tweezers. Additionally, a 15-day pilot incubation was attempted to estimate the number of disks needed for a significant respiromentical response, 6 disks per reactor was the optimal amount. Once preliminary results were discussed a mature experiment could be designed. The assessment included 3 incubation treatments for both freshwater and saltwater, reactors either contained compostable plastic, filter paper or no polymer, the former being the control for positive mineralization response and the latter the negative control where no response is expected. Tests were replicated into 4 separate reactors resulting in a total size of 24 reactors which was large enough to minimize noise after applying statistical methods. Moreover 6 empty reactors were simultaneously incubated to calibrate our measurements and obtain standardized results.

### Incubation procedure

Initially, 100 g of moist sediment were placed inside empty vessels followed by 200 mL of water from the corresponding sample. Marks were taken at the fill level to measure the volume later on. Fine particles from the lake sediment were slightly problematic as they tend to resuspended after pouring rising turbidity, the equilibrium was reached after a brief period of stillness. At that point, testing materials could be deposited on the sediment floor. The films were distributed evenly using a pair of long tweezers, avoiding overlapping to maximize contact area with the surrounding medium. Meanwhile, a 1 mol L\^-1\^ sodium hydroxide (NaOH) solution was prepared from solid pellets, then each cup was filled with 50 mL. OxiTop^Ⓡ^ gauges were checked for sufficient battery life beforehand, they were also calibrated by a pneumatic test following the instructions provided by the manufacturer [@wtw2006]. Once the lids were ready reactors were individually closed using 4 metal clips equidistantly arranged, adding a fine layer of grease at the border tire for extra sealing. Finally, pressure gauges were tightly screwed on top and reactors were randomly placed inside the incubator chamber. Extreme care was taken to avoid the strongly alkaline solution from spilling onto the medium which would kill the microorganism.

The incubator chamber kept the test at a constant temperature of 25°C in the dark, measurements were routinely checked every day until the end of the 30-day period. This was done to facilitate early failure detection which could cost much time if not addressed on time. At the end of the test, reactors were dismantled and testing materials were recovered for visual inspection. Medium volumes were determined by filling the vessels with water to the previously mentioned marks and pouring the amount into a graduated cylinder. Eventually, data could be extracted using vendor-provided software into individual spreadsheet files for each test. For tidiness, a unified comma-separated values (CSV) file was assembled following tidy practices suggested in @hadley2025.

## Statistical methods {#sec-stats}

### Pressure adjustment {.unnumbered}

Differences in pressure are adjusted offsetting from the mean value in the empty reactors---also called blanks. During the first couple of days, all blanks rose to approximately 9 hPa over the starting pressure (@fig-blanks). The response is likely due to warming air inside the reactor, because the incubator chamber was at 25°C, which was slightly above room temperature.

Reactor B27 lost pressure early in the experiment and dropped to zero, this behavior implies evident sealing defects and the reactor was not considered for the analysis.

Our goal is to measure differences in pressure due to oxygen consumption ---or CO~2~ production---, so we neutralized the effect of temperature by adjusting the pressure difference with the formula:

$$
\Delta{}p_{O_2} = \Delta{}p - \Delta{}\overline{p}_{0}
$$ {#eq-adj}

Were $p_{O_2}$ is the pressure difference driven by oxygen consumption, $p$ is the relative pressure of the reactors containing benthic habitats, and $\overline{p}_{0}$ is the average relative pressure measured in empty reactors ---excluding the failed reactor.

### BOD calculation {.unnumbered}

BOD was calculated using the formula from the OxiTop^Ⓡ^ Control operating manual [@wtw2006], the following equation established the relation between our measured variable, pressure difference, and biological oxygen demand (BOD).

$$
BOD=\frac{M_{O_2}}{RT_m}\left(\frac{V_t-V_h}{V_h}+\alpha{}\frac{T_m}{T_0}\right)\Delta{}p_{O_2}
$$ {#eq-bod}

where $M_{O_2}$ is oxygen gas molecular weight in mg O~2~ mol^-1^, $R$ is the gas constant in L hPa mol^-1^ K^-1^, $T_m$ is the sample temperature in K, $T_0$ is the reference temperature at 273.15 K (0 °C), $\alpha$ is the Bunsen absorption coefficient, $V_t$ is reactor volume in mL, $V_h$ is habitat volume, also in mL.

### Modelling BOD curves {.unnumbered}

Follwing the computation, a regression model was fitted to the BOD curves using an single exponential equation similar to the proposed by @metcalf1991.

$$
BOD_t=BOD_u\ (1-e^{-kt})
$$ {#eq-single-exp}

where $BOD_t$ is biological oxygen demand in mg of O~2~ L^-1^, $BOD_u$ is the theoretical ultimate BOD and corresponded to the value of the horizontal asymptote in mg O~2~ L^-1^, $k$ is the rate costant in days^-1^ which accounts for the speed of the degradation process.

Additionally, to compare a more accurate approach as evidenced by @mason2006, a more complex regression using a double exponential formula was also conducted.

$$
BOD_t=BOD_{u1}(1-e^{-k_1t})+BOD_{u2}(1-e^{-k_2t})
$$ {#eq-double-exp}

where $BOD_t$ is biological oxygen demand in mg of O~2~ L^-1^. $BOD_u$ is the theoretical ultimate BOD in $mg\ O_2\ L^{-1}$, $b$ is the logistic growth rate.
