## BOD determination {.unnumbered}

BOD was calculated using the formula:

$BOD=\frac{M_{O_2}}{RT_m}\left(\frac{V_t-V_h}{V_h}+\alpha{}\frac{T_m}{T_0}\right)\Delta{}p_{O_2}$

where

-   $M_{O_2}$ is oxygen gas molecular weight in $mg\cdot{}mol^{-1}$
-   $R$ is the gas constant in $L\cdot{}hPa\cdot{}mol^{-1}\cdot{}K^{-1}$
-   $T_m$ is the sample temperature in $K$
-   $T_0$ is the reference temperature in $K$
-   $\alpha$ is the Bunsen absorption coefficient
-   $V_t$ is reactor volume in $mL$
-   $V_h$ is habitat volume in $mL$


## Modelling {.unnumbered}

A logistic regression model will be fited to the measured curves using the equation proposed by :

$BOD_t=BOD_L\ (1-e^{-kt})$

@mason2006 Other formula

where

-   $BOD_t$ is biological oxygen demand in $mg\ O_2\ L^{-1}$
-   $t_{½}$ is the half-degradation time in days.
-   $BOD_L$ is the limit BOD in $mg\ O_2\ L^{-1}$
-   $b$ is the logistic growth rate.
