# Materials and Methods

## Testing materials

Compostable plastic bags were provided by @deiss2025 in the context of the @soplas2024, the material is commercially available under the trademark name ecovio^Ⓡ^ [@basf2025] and is made by blending PLA and PBAT polymers at variable proportions. PLA is synthesized from renewable feedstocks such as corn and sugar cane while PBAT has a nonrenewable fossil origin, resulting in a 50% renewable based material with a certified compostability under the European standard EN 13432 [@eubp2023]. Experimental test samples were prepared cutting the plastic film into discs of 20 mm diameter,

<!-- The present study adapts the test method of film biodegradation on the sandy sublittoral zone from @tosin2012. Briefly, the method consists in simulating environmental conditions found in the sublittoral region, in the case of the sea, and the near shore submerged benthic habitat for lake. The simulated habitat contains a two phased testing medium, a column of sea water and marine sediment (sea habitat) and a lake water and lake sediment for the lake habitat. The test material is preferably a film. -->

## Environmental sample collection

Sediment and water samples were collected from two different aquatic natural environments in Andalusia, Spain. One location was a the fresh water lake of La Breña (37°49'55.20''N, 5°2'12.84''W), in Cordoba, and the other at the Mediterranean coast of Los Boliches Beach (36°32'52.44''N, 4°36'54.72''W), in Malaga. Spots were chosen close to the shore at an approximate water depth of 1 meter, special care was taken when collecting the sediment samples inside 3L plastic bags to reliably avoid rocks and other objects that could interfere in the homogeneity of the sediment as far as possible. The filling of water was carried out using 5L plastic containers once submerged close to the bottom in order to avoid catching floating debris. Once the amount was sufficient, the samples were sealed and refrigerated as soon as possible with the aim of minimizing bacterial activity while in storage.

## Experimental procedure

Following the collection of the environment, pilot test were carried out in order to validate the sinking of the test polymers at the bottom of the reactor. It was hard at first to place the plastic due to air bubbles adhering to the surface, this could be solved by thoroughly loking for bubbles using a pair of tweezers.

The experiment consisted in 30 sealed gas reactors using OxiTop Control measuring heads which were placed inside an incubator for 30 days. over composes of a transparent glass jar was performed 30 reactor jars using OxiTop Control measuring head. Homogeneity between reactors was intended, the were filled first with dirt and then with water. Polymers were placed last using a pair of tweezers. We observed that plastic disks were more likely to rise afloat when tinny air bubbles adhered to their surface, special care was taken to remove these bubbles so the plastics disks could stay laying on the bed. We also considered spreading the disks over the sea bed, so they would not fall over one another. This could easily be done in the sea habitat, were water transparency was high. The minutes after filling, lake habitat turbidity was so high that the bottom could not be seen when looking form above, this was due to the suspension of fine particles and a settling time of some hours was needed in order to see the bottom.

The alkaline solution of KOH was prepared using KOH pellets, the small vasitos were filled using a probeta. The jar taps were placed adding a fine layer of sealing greases provided by the manufactured. Four metal clips agarraban el invento en equidistancia. OxiTop measuring heads were first calibrated using a jeringilla and the batery life was checked before the incubation. Finally the OxiTop measuring heads were tighted screewed. Some of the heads were damagaded, after visual inspection of the material, decidimos utilizar las cabezas más evidentemente dañadas para los blancos \[foto grieta\]. Once all the reactos were ready. Once the reactors were ready, they were transported in a wheeled trolley to the incubation chamber, which was previously working so the temperature was already stable at 25ºC. The reactors were randomly placed in the middle self of the incubator. This was intended para que ningun grupo experimental tuviese una vinculación a una parte concreta de la incubadora, que podría estar más fría o más caliente. A grid of 4 rows of 10 was achieved, the remaining 4 reactors were placed in the lower shelf. All of them blank reactors. The incubation first measurement was triggered at this moment and then the door was closed.

Reactors were routinely check every weekday at around 8 am by the same operator, una servidora. We controlled the progress of the experiment by visualizing the available reactor data curves one by one, this procedure enabled us to dectect possible sealing failures in the process, which could have been otherwise detected lately at the end of the experiment, but this would have implied a loss of precious time. Fortunately, only one blank reactor was damaged.

The final day of the incubation, reactors were dissampled and the data were extracted into sepparated .xlsx files for each reactor. A unified dataset .csv was build with R using the tidiverse core following tidy practices form (hadley, tidying). Then the reactors were opened and the polymer dics inspected for visual signs of biodegradation. None evident sign was evident for the plastics, the paper was black and could easily deshacerse. Upon closer inspection, some tiny pores could be observed for some plastic disks, which could be linked to biodegradation.

## Biological oxygen demand as a proxy for biodegradation

## Computational methods

### Pressure adjustment {.unnumbered}

Differences in pressure are adjusted offsetting from the mean value in the empty reactors---also called blanks. During the first couple of days, all blanks rose to approximately 9 hPa over the starting pressure (@fig-blanks). The response is likely due to warming air inside the reactor, because the incubator chamber was at 25°C, which was slightly above room temperature.

Reactor B27 lost pressure early in the experiment and dropped to zero, this behavior implies evident sealing defects and the reactor was not considered for the analysis.

Our goal is to measure differences in pressure due to oxygen consumption ---or CO~2~ production---, so we neutralized the effect of temperature by adjusting the pressure difference with the formula:

$$
\Delta{}p_{O_2} = \Delta{}p - \Delta{}\overline{p}_{blanks}
$$ {#eq-adj}

Were $p_{O_2}$ is the pressure difference driven by oxygen consumption, $p$ is the relative pressure of the reactors containing benthic habitats, and $\overline{p}_{blanks}$ is the average relative pressure measured in empty reactors ---excluding the failed reactor.

### BOD computation {.unnumbered}

BOD was calculated using the formula from the OxiTop Control operating manual [@wtw2006], the following equation established the relation between our measured variable, pressure difference, and biological oxygen demand (BOD).

$$
BOD=\frac{M_{O_2}}{RT_m}\left(\frac{V_t-V_h}{V_h}+\alpha{}\frac{T_m}{T_0}\right)\Delta{}p_{O_2}
$$ {#eq-bod}

where $M_{O_2}$ is oxygen gas molecular weight in mg O~2~ mol^-1^, $R$ is the gas constant in L hPa mol^-1^ K^-1^, $T_m$ is the sample temperature in K, $T_0$ is the reference temperature at 273.15 K (0 °C), $\alpha$ is the Bunsen absorption coefficient, $V_t$ is reactor volume in mL, $V_h$ is habitat volume, also in mL.

### Curve modelling {.unnumbered}

Follwing the computation, a regression model was fitted to the BOD curves using an single exponential equation similar to the proposed by @metcalf1991.

$$
BOD_t=BOD_u\ (1-e^{-kt})
$$ {#eq-single-exp}

where $BOD_t$ is biological oxygen demand in mg of O~2~ L^-1^, $BOD_u$ is the theoretical ultimate BOD and corresponded to the value of the horizontal asymptote in mg O~2~ L^-1^, $k$ is the rate costant in days^-1^ which accounts for the speed of the degradation process.

Additionally, in order to compare a more accurate approach as evidenced by @mason2006, a more complex regression using a double exponential formula was also conducted.

$$
BOD_t=BOD_{u1}(1-e^{-k_1t})+BOD_{u2}(1-e^{-k_2t})
$$ {#eq-double-exp}

where $BOD_t$ is biological oxygen demand in mg of O~2~ L^-1^. $BOD_u$ is the theoretical ultimate BOD in $mg\ O_2\ L^{-1}$, $b$ is the logistic growth rate.
