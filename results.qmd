## Blank evolution

Differences in pressure are adjusted offsetting from the mean value in the empty reactors---also called blanks. During the first couple of days, all blanks rose to approximately 9 hPa over the starting pressure (@fig-blanks). The response is likely due to warming air inside the reactor, because the incubator chamber was at 25Â°C, which was slightly above room temperature.

Reactor B27 lost pressure early in the experiment and dropped to zero, this behavior implies evident sealing defects and the reactor was not considered for the analysis.

Our goal is to measure differences in pressure due to oxygen consumption ---or CO-2- production---, so we neutralized the effect of temperature by adjusting the pressure difference with the formula:

$p_{OD} = p - \overline{p}_{blanks}$

Were $p_{OD}$ is the pressure difference driven by oxygen consumption, $p$ is the relative pressure of the reactors containing benthic habitats, and $\overline{p}_{blanks}$ is the average relative pressure measured in empty reactors ---excluding reactor B27.
