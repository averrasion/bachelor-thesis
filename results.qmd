The OxiTop Control system measured pressure differences inside the reactor since the beginning of the incubation (@fig-pressures).

Differences in pressure are adjusted offsetting from the mean value in the empty reactors---also called blanks. During the first couple of days, all blanks rose to approximately 9 hPa over the starting pressure (@fig-blanks). The response is likely due to warming air inside the reactor, because the incubator chamber was at 25°C, which was slightly above room temperature.

Reactor B27 lost pressure early in the experiment and dropped to zero, this behavior implies evident sealing defects and the reactor was not considered for the analysis.

## medium characterization

<!-- This section aims to compare oxygen demand between the aquatic environment recreated in the experiment. For purposes of characterization of baseline conditions, only data from reactors not containing specimens —negative controls in section 4.2— are evaluated. It is important to note that the conditions recreated in the laboratory are not intended to represent the whole aquatic environments. They resemble the local conditions from the geographic locations in which water and sediment were collected, in this case the Playa de los Boliches and Playa del Pantano de la Breña, for the sea and water environments, respectively. -->
<!-- BOD in benthic mediums is affected by multiple factors including temperature, microbial community, nutrient concentration, dissolved organic matter (DOM) and particulate organic matter (POM). Incubation temperature remained at 25 ºC, which is higher that environmental conditions. This unrealistic temperature was set to accelerate BOD, which increased the change of measuring significative differences within the reduced experiment duration of 30 days. Microbial communities were naturally occurring, contained in the unfiltered water and sediment from the respective samples. Nutrient concentration was conserved from the field samples. It’s important to note that from field sampling to experimental setup slight variations happened in the storing facility, however they were minimized as storing temperature of 7 ºC. -->
<!-- BOD30 remained below 60 mg O2 L-1 in the sea medium while the lake was higher than 90 mg O2 L-1. This significative difference evidences a higher microbial activity in fresh water over sea water. -->
