For purposes of characterization of baseline conditions, only data from reactors not containing specimens —negative controls in section 4.2— are evaluated. It is important to note that the conditions recreated in the laboratory are not intended to represent the whole aquatic environments. They resemble the local conditions from the geographic locations in which water and sediment were collected, in this case the Playa de los Boliches and Playa del Pantano de la Breña, for the sea and water environments, respectively.\nBOD in benthic habitats is affected by multiple factors including temperature, microbial community, nutrient concentration, dissolved organic matter (DOM) and particulate organic matter (POM). Incubation temperature remained at 25 ºC, which is higher that environmental conditions. This unrealistic temperature was set to accelerate BOD, which increased the change of measuring significative differences within the reduced experiment duration of 30 days. Microbial communities were naturally occurring, contained in the unfiltered water and sediment from the respective samples. Nutrient concentration was conserved from the field samples. It’s important to note that from field sampling to experimental setup slight variations happened in the storing facility, however they were minimized as storing temperature of 7 ºC.\nBOD30 remained below 60 mg O2 L-1 in the sea habitat while the lake was higher than 90 mg O2 L-1. This significative difference evidences a higher microbial activity in fresh water over sea water.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](results_files/figure-pdf/unnamed-chunk-1-1.pdf)\n:::\n:::\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n## BOD\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![Biological oxygen demand evolution summary.
